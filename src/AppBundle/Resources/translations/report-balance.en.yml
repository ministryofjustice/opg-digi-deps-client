         After you have entered all of %client%'s income and expenses,
         you should have a sum of money that matches the one you entered in the
         closing balance in <a href="%accountsLink%">bank accounts</a>.
         %paragraphBreak%
         If the two sums don't match, first, check that the figures you gave in <a href="%accountsLink%">bank accounts</a> are correct. If the amounts still don't match, go back and carefully check that you have included all of %client%'s incomings and outgoings correctly in the <a href="%moneyInLink%">money in</a> and <a href="%moneyOutLink%">money out</a> sections.
