<div class="text">
  <p>In order to use this service, you will need to enter information including names, addresses, other contact details, dates of birth and the relationship of involved parties to the client. We use this information to populate a report and for no other purpose. OPG doesn't see what you’ve entered into the service until you have submitted the report.</p>
  <p>Separately from the information entered by those using this service, OPG also collects site-usage information from this service This allows us to see how the service is being used so we can improve it. This information does not contain any personal data.</p>
  <p>We’ll only ever collect information that will help us make the site work better for you: information that will let us contact you if you’ve asked us to, let us give you accurate information if you need it, and give us a sense of how people are using the service, so we can keep improving it.</p>
  <p>You have the right as the owner of the account to delete it, or any and all information in it, at any point.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large text">3. What happens when I submit my report?</h2>
<div class="text">
  <p>When you click submit within the service a version of the annual report is sent to a mail box which is accessed by OPG and kept in accordance with the privacy policy.</p>
  <p>Within the application itself, any reports that have been submitted to the OPG can no longer be changed. But prior to the submission of the report, there is a ‘save and return’ functionality that gives the deputy the opportunity to change any information they have entered in the system. The save and return function will be explained at the beginning of the form.</p>
  <p>However, deputies are still able to request for their data to be corrected and the service’s terms and conditions will include information on how to correct data that has already been submitted through their deputy report.</p>

  <p>You stay signed in until you sign out, or until 20 minutes elapse from the time you close or navigate away from the service. This is in order to keep the service secure.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="heading-medium text">All data collected by this service is stored in our secure database and is kept within the European Economic Area (EEA).</h3>

<h2 class="heading-large text">8. How can OPG stop making the deputy service available to you and what happens if it does so?</h2>

<h3 class="heading-medium text">OPG’s right to stop making the deputy service available to you</h3>
<p class="text">OPG reserves the right to stop making all or any part of the service available to you with immediate effect and without notice if: in its sole reasonable opinion you are using the service, and/or any other OPG service, inappropriately (for instance harassing or causing distress or inconvenience to any other person), incompetently or in any way that may constitute derogatory treatment of the OPG or might bring the OPG into disrepute or in a way that might be considered to be prejudicial to the image of the OPG; you breach the terms in a way that cannot be corrected, or you fail to correct a breach within a reasonable period of time if the OPG asks you to do so; or there is, in the OPG’s reasonable opinion, any reason why the Complete the deputy report service must be withdrawn.</p>


<h2 class="heading-large">9. What other (general) terms apply?</h2>

<h3 class="heading-medium text">What happens if the OPG does not enforce a right against me?</h3>
<p class="text">If the OPG decides not to exercise or enforce any right that it has against you at a particular time, then this does not prevent the OPG from later deciding to exercise or enforce that right.</p>

<h3 class="heading-medium text">What happens if any part of the terms is found to be ineffective?</h3>
<p class="text">If any part of the terms is found to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court or regulator, then, where required, that part shall be deleted from the terms and the remaining parts of the terms will continue to be enforceable.</p>

<h3 class="heading-medium text">Matters beyond OPG’s reasonable control</h3>
<p class="text">OPG is not liable for any breach or disruptions caused to the service caused by matters beyond its reasonable control including acts of God, fire, lightning, explosion, war, disorder, flood, industrial disputes, weather of exceptional severity and unavoidable hardware or software failures.</p>

<p class="text">The terms do not create or infer any rights that are enforceable by any person who is not party to the terms.</p>

<h3 class="heading-medium">Transfer of rights</h3>
<p class="text">You may not assign, sub-license or otherwise transfer any of your rights and obligations in the terms to any other person.</p>

<h3 class="heading-medium text">What happens if there is a dispute arising out of the terms?</h3>
<div class="text">
  <p>Any disputes arising out of the terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. If you choose to bring proceedings in connection with the terms you must do so in the courts of England and Wales.</p>
  <p>Within the application itself, any reports that have been submitted to the OPG can no longer be changed. But prior to the submission of the report, there is a ‘save and return’ functionality which gives the Deputy the opportunity to change any information they have entered in the system. The save and return function will be explained at the beginning of the form.</p>
  <p>However, Deputies are still able to request for their data to be corrected and the service’s Terms and conditions will include information on how to correct data that has already been submitted through their annual report.</p>
