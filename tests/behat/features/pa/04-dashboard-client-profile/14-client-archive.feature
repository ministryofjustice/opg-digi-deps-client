Feature: PA client archive

  Scenario: PA archives a client
    Given I load the application status from "team-users-complete"

    And I click on "pa-report-open" in the "client-1000016" region

    # archive-cancel
    When I click on "client-archive"
    Then I should see the "confirm-cancel" link

    Then the URL should match "report/\d+/overview"

    # archive-no-confirm
    When I click on "client-archive"
    And I press "pa_client_archive_save"
    Then the following fields should have an error:

    And I press "pa_client_archive_save"
    Then the form should be valid
    And I should be on "/pa/"
