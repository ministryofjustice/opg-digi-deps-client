Feature: Report 104 start

  @deputy @104
  Scenario: load app status to common sections completed, change type to 104 and check not submittable
    Given I load the application status from "102-common-sections-complete"
    And I change the report of the client with case number "1000014" to "104-6"

  @deputy @104
  Scenario: test tabs for 104
    # assert not submittable yet
    Given I am logged in as "behat-pa1@publicguardian.gsi.gov.uk" with password "Abcd1234"
    # click on 104 report
    And I click on "pa-report-open" in the "client-1000014" region
    #test tabs
