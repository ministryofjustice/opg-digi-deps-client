    Scenario: account transfers
        Given I am logged in as "behat-user@publicguardian.gsi.gov.uk" with password "Abcd1234"
#        And die 1
#        And I click on "reports, report-2016-to-2017, edit-money_transfers"
#        # wrong values (wrong amount types, amount without explanation, explanation without amount)
#        When I press "transfers_save"
#        Then the following fields should have an error:
#            | transfers_accountFromId |
#            | transfers_accountToId   |
#            | transfers_amount        |
#        And I save the page as "report-account-transfers-errors"
#        # right values
#        When I fill in "transfers_amount" with "1200"
#        And I select "HSBC main account Current account (****0876)" from "transfers_accountFromId"
#        And I select "temp ISA (****8888)" from "transfers_accountToId"
#        And I press "transfers_save"
#        Then the form should be valid
#        Then I should see the "transfer" region
#        # delete
#        When I click on "delete-confirm"
#        Then I should not see the "transfer" region
#        # no transfers
#        Given the checkbox "report_no_transfers_noTransfersToAdd" is not checked
#        When I check "report_no_transfers_noTransfersToAdd"
#        And I press "report_no_transfers_saveNoTransfer"
#        Then the checkbox "report_no_transfers_noTransfersToAdd" should be checked
