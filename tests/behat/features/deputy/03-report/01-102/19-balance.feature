        And I should see an "#finances-section .behat-alert-message" element
        And the lay report should not be submittable
        # check balance mismatch difference
        When I click on "balance-view-details"
        Then I should see the "balance-bad" region
        And I should see "Â£191.11" in the "unaccounted-for" region
        # fix balance
        And I save the application status into "balance-before-adding-explanation"
        And I click on "step-back, edit-bank_accounts"
        And I click on "edit" in the "account-11cf" region
