Feature: Admin unsubmit report (from client page)

  @deputy
  Scenario: Admin client page + search
    Given I am logged in to admin as "admin@publicguardian.gsi.gov.uk" with password "Abcd1234"
    And I click on "admin-client-search"
    Then each text should be present in the corresponding region:
      | 8 clients | client-search-count |
    Then each text should be present in the corresponding region:
      | Cly Hent | client-behat001 |
    When I fill in the following:
      | search_clients_q | hent |
    And I click on "search_clients_search"
    Then I should see the "client-row" region exactly "1" times
    And each text should be present in the corresponding region:
      | Cly Hent | client-behat001 |
    And I click on "client-details" in the "client-behat001" region
    And I save the current URL as "admin-client-search-client-behat001"
