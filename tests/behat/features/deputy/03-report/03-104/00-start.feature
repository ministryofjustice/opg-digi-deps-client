Feature: Report 104 start

  @deputy
  Scenario: load app status taken after 102 non-financial sections are completed
    Given I load the application status from "report-decisions-contacts-visitscare-actions-info"
    And I change the report of the client with case number "behat001" to "104"

  @deputy
  Scenario: test tabs for 104
    And I am logged in as "behat-user@publicguardian.gsi.gov.uk" with password "Abcd1234"
    And I click on "report-start"
